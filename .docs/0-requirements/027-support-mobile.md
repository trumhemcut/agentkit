This is mostly front-end work.

The app for now is not good at mobile view, so we may need to support mobile view.

These are some ideas, but you can add more

## Mobile Sidebar Drawer 🎯

* Hide sidebar completely on mobile
* Show as overlay when triggered by hamburger menu
* Swipe gestures to open/close

## Responsive Header 📱

* Stack Agent/Provider/Model selectors vertically on mobile
* Add hamburger menu for sidebar access
* Flexible height instead of fixed 64px

## Chat/Canvas Tab Navigation 🔄

* Switch between Chat and Canvas views on mobile (can't fit side-by-side)
* Keep side-by-side layout on desktop
* Clear visual indicators for active tab

## Nice to Have:

* Swipe gestures for navigation
* Pull-to-refresh
* Bottom navigation bar (alternative pattern)
* PWA support for install-to-home-screen
