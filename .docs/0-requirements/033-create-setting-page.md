As an admin user, I need to setup the setting page for the agents that I have created. I need to build the frontend for this. Backend will come later since I need to have a feel of UI/UX. Also, I think in the left menu at the bottom, it would be a menu item with named "Settings", and when I click that button, the setting page will appear.
